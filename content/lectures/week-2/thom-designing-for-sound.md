# What is Sound Design?

> What's the point Thom is making in the first paragraph?

By experimenting with sound, playing with sound (and not just sound effects, but music and dialog as well) all through production and post production what Francis Coppola, Walter Murch, George Lucas, and Ben Burtt found is that sound began to shape the picture sometimes as much as the picture shaped the sound.

> What is Thom's issue with sound design in many movies today?

Sound, musical and otherwise, has value when it is part of a continuum, when it changes over time, has dynamics, and resonates with other sound and with other sensory experiences.

He also wants directors to design the film with sound in mind, to allow sound’s contributions to influence creative decisions in the other crafts.

# A Thing Almost Alive

But doesn’t it seem odd that in this supposedly collaborative medium, music and sound effects rarely have the opportunity to exert any influence on the non-sound crafts? How is the Director supposed to know how to make the film without having a plan for using music?

# The Basic Terrain, As It Is Now

What follows is a list of some of the bleak realities faced by those of us who work in film sound, and some suggestions for improving the situation.

## Pre-Production

The degree to which sound is eventually able to participate in storytelling will be more determined by the use of time, space, and point of view in the story than by how often the script mentions actual sounds.

> what are the best sound sequences in film according to Thom?

Most of the great sound sequences in films are "pov" sequences. The photography, the blocking of actors, the production design, art direction, editing, and dialogue have been set up such that we, the audience, are experiencing the action more or less through the point of view of one, or more, of the characters in the sequence.

## Production

Not much thought on set's is given to the needs of sound recording. This is due to noise of the construction of the set but also the way the scenes are blocked.

## Post Production

When sound usually becomes part of the process with a composer and supervising sound editor.

The composer is given four or five weeks to produce seventy to ninety minutes of great music. The supervising sound editor is given ten to fifteen weeks to—smooth out the production dialog—spot, record, and edit ADR—and try to wedge a few specific sound effects into sequences that were never designed to use them, being careful to cover every possible option the Director might want because there "isn’t any time" for the Director to make choices before the mix.

> What is ADR and why is it necessary on films?

## Taking Sound Seriously

> Do you agree or disagree that film is a primarily visual medium?

## Writing For Sound

> What is the most important aspect of writing for Thom to make a film cinematic?

It seems to me that one element of writing for movies stands above all others in terms of making the eventual movie as "cinematic" as possible: establishing point of view. The audience experiences the action through its identification with characters. The writing needs to lay the ground work for setting up pov before the actors, cameras, microphones, and editors come into play. Each of these can obviously enhance the element of pov, but the script should contain the blueprint.

We'll skip some of the idea for writing scripts...

## Sound's Talents

Music, dialogue, and sound effects can each do any of the following jobs, and many more:

- suggest a mood, evoke a feeling set a pace
- indicate a geographical locale indicate a historical period
- clarify the plot
- define a character
- connect otherwise unconnected ideas, characters, places,
- images, or moments
- heighten realism or diminish it
- heighten ambiguity or diminish it
- draw attention to a detail, or away from it
- indicate changes in time
- smooth otherwise abrupt changes between shots or scenes emphasize a transition for dramatic effect
- describe an acoustic space
- startle or soothe
