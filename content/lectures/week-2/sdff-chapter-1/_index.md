This is a version of experimental composer John Cage's 4'33'' in which the musicians are instructed not to play their instruments for the duration of the performance. The piece's sound is whatever is audible in the space during those four minutes and thirty-three seconds.

The piece becomes the acoustic environment for the duration of the performance. We can also describe this as a soundscape.

**What acoustic environment came out of this performance?**

Work like this promotes a different type of listening that is beneficial to develop your ear for creating sound design for film.

Pauline Oliveros describes this kind of meditation as deep listening – a reflective practice that works towards an intuitive and profound understanding of sound.

## Should we go outside? 

### Bring some paper and something to write with

### Listing Activity A

> Immerse yourself in the soundscape of your present experience. Close your eyes and listen to the sounds around you. Focus on one sound source at a time, trying to feel rather than think about it. Explore the shape, texture and rhythm of each layer before moving on to the next. Continue this cycle until you have taken in every sound within your field of hearing.

## Breaking down the soundscape

- R. Murray Schafer
  - *Geophony* - Sounds of the Earth (for example, whistling wind, creaking glaciers, rumbling volcanoes). 
  - *Biophony* - Sounds of non-human life (for example, chirping insects, warbling birdsong, howling wolves). 
  - *Anthrophony* - Sounds of humanity (for example, clanging industry, babbling voices, beeping machines). 

Listen to the [Soundscape map](https://www.world-sounds.org/map/)

As we listen, let's order the sounds into these three categories. Keep these concepts in mind as you're working on your sound designs.

### Listening Activity B

> Return to the soundscape of your current situation with a more thoughtful ear. Perhaps you can hear rain, wind or other planetary sounds. Are there animals or birds in earshot? How many layers of human sounds are present? Note down everything you can hear across the three soundscape categories.

## Listening and audience

What emotions can be associated with sounds we've heard so far? Or others such as wind, birdsong, or car engines?

{{% note %}}
It's not necessarily a universal truth that everyone will find the same emotion in the same sounds.

Some sounds are purely informational and not meant to be emotional.

Sounds that we don't hear but feel still strongly impact us. We can hear these sounds through subwoofers that produce only low frequencies.

## Listening Activity C

> Choose three elements in your current soundscape. How do the different sounds make you feel, if anything? Note down your responses.
