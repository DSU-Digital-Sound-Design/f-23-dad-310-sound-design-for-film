Foley artists play a crucial role in the sound design process of films, television shows, games, and independent films. Here's a breakdown of how they work:

1. **Preparation:** Foley artists start their work on the Foley stage by gathering the necessary equipment, including shoes and props, for the session. They review cue sheets, which provide information on when specific sounds are needed in the production.

2. **Planning:** Before starting the actual recording, Foley artists plan the first few cues. This involves deciding what sounds they need to create and how to produce them effectively.

3. **Observation:** In the case of live-action or animated films, there is often an opportunity to watch a portion of the show at the beginning. This helps the Foley artists get a sense of the timing and the amount of work required for the session.

4. **Variability:** The nature of the project can influence how Foley sessions unfold. For features and long-form episodic shows, there is usually a planning stage known as a spotting session. This session allows for detailed discussions and planning regarding sound effects. However, for television shows, weekly cartoons, games, or independent films, this may not be as common. Technological advancements can expedite the workflow, potentially leading to the elimination of spotting sessions and cue sheets.

5. **Importance of Spotting and Cueing:** Spotting sessions and cue sheets are essential for quality Foley work. They ensure clear communication between editors and Foley professionals, helping them sync sound effects accurately with the visuals. When these tools are lacking, Foley artists may need to adapt and work with less structured guidance.

6. **Adaptation:** Foley artists are accustomed to adapting to various situations in the entertainment industry. While the ideal scenario includes spotting sessions and detailed cueing, they understand that flexibility is necessary in their line of work.

7. **Balancing Standards:** Maintaining industry standards is important, as it allows for smoother collaboration and quality results. However, Foley artists also need to know when to make adjustments and when to stick to established practices, depending on the specific project's requirements and constraints.

In summary, Foley artists are responsible for creating and recording sound effects that enhance the realism and immersion of audiovisual productions. While ideal conditions involve planning sessions and cue sheets, they are adaptable professionals who can work effectively even when these elements are not in place, ensuring that the sound design complements the visuals seamlessly.

Here's an overview of what typically happens during a spotting session:

- **Participants:** The key participants in a spotting session include the supervising sound editor (SSE), the director, and the picture editor. In some cases, the first picture assistant and the ADR (Automated Dialogue Replacement) supervisor may also attend, and occasionally, the Foley supervisor may be present.

- **Purpose:** The primary purpose of the spotting session is to discuss and plan the sound design for the project. It's an opportunity for creative collaboration and decision-making regarding the use of sound effects, music, and dialogue in the production.

- **Rare Occurrence:** In recent times, spotting sessions involving multiple sound professionals have become less common. Budget constraints often discourage the inclusion of additional team members in such sessions, as some consider them unnecessary expenses.

- **Cost vs. Benefit:** Despite the budget concerns, a well-structured spotting session can ultimately save a production thousands of dollars during the final mix stage. It helps in preplanning and ensures that the sound elements align seamlessly with the visuals.

- **Serious and Grueling:** Contrary to the perception of spotting sessions as playful brainstorming sessions, they are often intense and demanding. The participants must make critical decisions about sound design that will profoundly impact the project's overall quality.

In summary, the spotting session is a crucial aspect of sound design where key team members come together to plan and discuss how sound will be used in the production. While budget considerations have led to the decline of some traditional spotting sessions, their value in saving time and money in the later stages of production cannot be underestimated. These sessions are typically focused and serious, involving important creative and technical decisions.

Cue sheets and the cueing process in Foley editing have evolved over time, with changes in technology and workflow. Here's an overview of how this process has transformed:

- **Traditional Cue Sheets:**
  - In the past, experienced and meticulous Foley editors would create handwritten cue sheets for the Foley crew on the stage.
  - Cue sheets were organized in vertical columns, with the main character's footsteps starting in tracks one, two, three, and so on.
  - Middle tracks were reserved for background footstep cues, while the outside tracks were designated for various props. The final track was typically used for cloth pass sounds.

- **Transition to Pro Tools:**
  - Nowadays, most cueing is done using Pro Tools, a digital audio workstation.
  - Cue tracks are horizontal in Pro Tools, but the fundamental approach remains the same.
  - Instead of handwriting cues, editors mark and tag cues directly within the Pro Tools session.
  - The session is saved on a hard drive, flash drive, or sometimes sent to a server for accessibility.
  - The Foley stage loads the sessions from the server or drive, and the cues are recorded directly into the regions marked in Pro Tools.
  - Cue sheets can still be printed from the Pro Tools sessions for reference.

- **Loose Cueing for Foley:**
  - Unlike ADR (Automated Dialogue Replacement), which is cued precisely to match actors' lip movements, Foley cueing can be more loosely timed.
  - Foley artists work with the context of the scene and anticipate the action rather than cueing to the first specific movement.
  - Some "breath" or pause before the cue begins is often preferred by mixers and artists.
  - Some recording equipment has "streamers" to assist with sync, but many Foley artists rely on visual cues.

- **Flow in Cueing:**
  - Cues for Foley work best when they have a natural flow.
  - If the picture alternates between different perspectives or characters (e.g., Jane walking down the hall, then Max in the kitchen), it's more efficient to keep Jane's cue going rather than stopping and cueing for each cut.
  - This approach ensures a more natural and relaxed performance by the Foley artist, as Foley is considered a performance art.

- **Digital Advantages:**
  - Digital cueing in Pro Tools has significantly sped up the process compared to handwritten cue sheets.
  - Editors can easily select recording tracks and input cues digitally.
  - The precision in selecting tracks is not as critical now, as Foley mixers can adjust tracks more flexibly on the stage.
  - Shorter schedules have also reduced the time allocated for cueing in modern Foley editing.

In summary, the transition from handwritten cue sheets to digital cueing in Pro Tools has streamlined the Foley editing process, making it more efficient and adaptable. Foley cueing is less rigid than ADR cueing, focusing on anticipation and maintaining a natural flow for the artists' performances. The digital age has brought about significant time savings in the cueing process.

## Cuing Process

1. **Scene Analysis:** Editors watch scenes carefully.
2. **Cueing Main Characters:** They assign main characters to specific tracks for footsteps. For complex walks, different tracks may be used.
3. **Background Characters:** Background characters are also assigned tracks with direction indicators. Names are less important for them.
4. **Clarity in Cues:** Editors aim for clear, concise cues, especially if cue sheets won't be used.

When editors cue Foley for a production, they follow specific guidelines and conventions to ensure accuracy and efficiency. Here's an overview of the cueing process:

- **Thorough Scene Analysis:**
  - Editors watch each scene multiple times to understand the specific sound requirements.

- **Cueing Main Characters:**
  - Editors typically start by cueing the main characters in the scene, character by character.
  - Main characters are assigned to consistent tracks; for example, Mimi on track one, Joe on track two, Maurice on track three, and so on.
  - If a character's walk involves multiple surfaces, the editor may assign different tracks for each surface, ensuring the Foley artist can perform the transition smoothly.

- **Background Characters (BGs):**
  - Editors then consider background characters, which can be groups or individuals.
  - If a background character moves across the screen (right to left or left to right), they are often placed on separate tracks with a direction indication.
  - For BGs, names are less important; characteristics like clothing color, height, or other identifiers help Foley artists quickly identify the cues.

- **Precision with Conciseness:**
  - Editors aim to provide precise cues without unnecessary verbosity, especially if cue sheets won't be used, and cues will be read digitally.
  - Clarity in cues is essential; for example, instead of "man carrying child," specifying "which" man carrying a child is crucial if multiple men carry children in a scene.

## Cueing Con't

5. **Cueing Props:** They assign props to tracks, grouping similar ones together.
6. **Microphone Adjustment:** The mixer adjusts the microphone for recording specific props.
7. **Clear Roadmap:** Editors create a clear plan for Foley artists and mixers to ensure everyone is on the same page.


{{% note %}}
- **Cueing Props:**
  - After cueing footsteps and characters, editors move on to cueing props used in the scene.
  - Similar props are assigned to similar tracks; for instance, paper cues are separate from metal cues or cues for leather chairs.
  - Grouping cues by "food groups" like paper, hand pats, body falls, metal crashes, and more helps Foley artists perform efficiently.

- **Microphone Adjustment:**
  - On the Foley stage, the mixer adjusts the microphone to record specific props as they are performed.
  - Grouping similar props on the same tracks streamlines the recording process for Foley artists.

- **Clear Roadmap:**
  - Editors create a clear roadmap for both Foley artists and mixers.
  - The goal is to ensure everyone is on the same page, both literally (referring to the cue sheet or digital cues) and figuratively, to facilitate smooth and accurate Foley recording.

In summary, cueing Foley involves meticulous planning and organization. Editors prioritize main characters, background characters, and props, assigning them to appropriate tracks. Clarity and conciseness in cue descriptions are crucial for effective communication, and grouping similar cues together helps streamline the Foley recording process. The ultimate aim is to provide a clear roadmap for the Foley team to deliver the desired sound effects seamlessly.
