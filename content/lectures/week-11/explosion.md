Create a dramatic explosion soundscape for a key moment in an action film. This complex sound design will require thoughtful layering of elements across frequency ranges to build tension and release.

Our explosion occurs when the protagonist triggers a detonator, igniting a series of charges they had planted around the antagonist's lair. The goal is to create a visceral yet stylized Hollywood explosion that supports the visuals and dramatic arc. 

Begin by gathering raw material - rumbles, punches, fire crackles, roars, hisses, and debris movements. Source these from online libraries like SoundQ, recording your own efforts, and manipulating pitch, speed, and direction. 

Organize layers into folder tracks:

- Rumble - deep, sustained, ominous tones
- Punch - sharp attacks to punctuate key moments 
- Fire - chaotic crackling and whooshing 
- Roar - mid-range turbulent rush
- Hiss - sizzling, pressure releasing
- Debris - crashing, falling objects

Shape each layer's envelope and automate effects. Align distinct moments like detonation impacts and building collapses. Design the stereo field to match camera perspectives. EQ and compress thoughtfully. 

The overall arc moves from tension to release. Draw the audience into the protagonist's focused act, shocking their senses, then resolve in smoke and ruin. Match the drama and emotions of the scene through imaginative sound design.
