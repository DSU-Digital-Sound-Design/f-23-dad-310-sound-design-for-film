# NOISE VS. SOUND: FOLEY AS IT IS USED IN THE VARIOUS GENRES

## Musical sound 

{{% note %}}
Old­fashioned film musicals utilized a lot of Foley for the dance sequences.

In Singin’ in the Rain (1952), Donald O’Connor’s performance in “Make ‘em Laugh” is a combination of production sound, “looping” of some dialogue, dance Foley, and prop work. The beginning of the scene has O’Connor and Gene Kelly walking in front of set pieces while talking. This dialogue leads into O’Connor’s song, where he sits on a piano, sings, fiddles with various items, and dances. All of his hand props and his dancing are Foley. The piano keys he steps on and his singing are from a prerecorded track. What is notable is that the background props are not audible. The Foley focuses on the foreground props. The lack of background props and footsteps is striking by today’s cinematic tastes. There is an artificiality to the track that was totally acceptable to the taste and genre of the 1950s.

White Nights (1985), on the other hand, has a scene that demonstrates a similar purpose for Foley footsteps and dancing, but for a different genre. This film is a musical drama. Gregory Hines plays an expatriate American living in the Soviet Union in the 1980s. He tells his bitter story of how he left the United States with dance. He narrates his story by dramatizing his childhood, experiences in Vietnam, and devolvement into a desperate life. The production track has Hines’s footsteps and scuffs in the track. He enhanced his dancing on a custom­made stage, and I Foleyed his footsteps for the scene. **The final soundtrack consists of a blend of production foot­ steps, Foley footsteps, and Foleyed dance steps.** The purpose of the dance is unique, and the hybrid of the three layers of footsteps is unusual. The goal was to sound natural and subtle.

Although both films combined production, dance Foley, and tradi­tional Foley footsteps and props, the styles are very different. Both films succeed in their sonic goals because the craftspeople involved under­stood the purpose and style of the films and knew how to utilize the technology of the times appropriately.

## Cultural sound

{{% note %}}
Styles in sound reflect styles in cultures. As was illustrated in Leone’s Italian­produced films, most of the sound and dialogue were replaced. This has been a frequent experience in Italian cinema. The sound has not been a primary concern in production; rather, it would be addressed mostly in postproduction. Some French films, on the other hand, seem to have an impressionism style that is utilized in the approach to sound.

Some French films, on the other hand, seem to have an **impressionism** style that is utilized in the approach to sound. In **Au Revoir Les Enfants (1987)**, Foley is added in an indicative manner. When the young boys in the school are walking around atop walking stilts, there is a general sense of the prop, but one cannot really discern one character’s actions from another’s. When they are eating in the din­ing area, there is a sense of activity with the bowls of food and eating, yet there is no clear accounting of who is doing what.

In Run Lola Run (1998), the fast cross­cutting requires a different task of the sound design and Foley. The sounds are specific and precise. Each detail of Lola’s three “runs” is essential to the viewer’s understanding of the plot. The Foley adds distinction to Lola’s escapades, which allows clearer comprehension as the narrative evolves to the climax and conclusion.

Dancer in the Dark (2000), and other films by Lars von Trier, offers some interesting situations regarding Foley utilization. As one of the co­creators of Dogme 95, with its manifesto regarding naturalistic film­ making, von Trier’s rules were disregarded in Dancer in the Dark when he included singing, artificial sound design, and Foley. Julien Naudin has been von Trier’s preferred Foley artist.

# SINGLE OR MARRIED FOLEY AND SOUND EFFECTS

{{% note %}}
When most professionals started utilizing Foley in their soundtracks, what they usually had in mind was replacing or enhancing the footsteps of the characters and performing a few hand props. This was the original role of Foley. It is essential to understand when Foley is relied upon to enhance or “sweeten” the production track and when it is an essential part of the layering of sound effects. Additionally, Foley is becoming relied upon as a viable option for special sound design. As is true with any art form or craft, it evolves and transforms into something more than its original purpose. Foley can stand on its own in a track and assist in creating the reality of the story world, it can be layered atop the pro­duction track to enhance the story world, and it can be combined with the edited sound effects to create hyperreality.

## Supporting Reality

* Foley to support reality, aka production sound 
  * The Foley artist tries to match everything recorded on set 
* A complement to edited sound effects 
  * ex: giving life to a car crash SFX

## Enhancing Reality

Sometimes a supervisor has it in mind to have the Foley cover what is traditionally edited from library effects or customized field record­ings. In Sylvester (1985), a film about a girl and her horse, some of the scenes had excellent production horse footsteps. The supervisor was not certain how his library horse footstep effects would work so, as an alternative, I Foleyed all of the horse footsteps. 

Now this has been done before, but sometimes editors would edit horses in from various library effects for time and cost­efficiency. The supervisor had decided to have additional “coverage” from several sources so the decision could be made during the final dub. What resulted was that some scenes were production sound, some were library effects, some were Foley (single track, single effect), and some were Foley married to the sound effects. 

The Foley artist should do whatever works best. To enhance reality means working with the reality of the sound but adding to it to give it an extra bit of character so it works better with the story.

A typical effect that is a married effect between Foley and sound effects is the ever­present body fall. Typically, the Foley artist will be down on the ground with some cloth or padding and will use the weight of the trunk of their body to thrust with control onto the floor. This performance will be combined with whatever has been cut in effects, which is usually some heavy thump sound of one or two tracks. The result is a body fall with the character from Foley and the weight from sound effects. Body falls never sound like they would in real life.

In Die Hard (1988), there is a scene in which Al, the friendly Los Angeles police officer, has a dead body land on his car. He frantically tries to drive away and ends up crashing his car. Supervising sound edi­ tor Steve Flick had his editors cut in most of the crash, but we sweetened it with some Foley stage hits against the car, the crunching of the metal and squeaking of the car door. Once again, this was a married effect. However, this scene was full of action combined with humor to reflect what was included in the script.

## Replacing Reality 

{{% note %}}
When a film or show requires a newly imagined aural reality, the Foley needs to reflect that reality with the imagined characters. This happens most often when the character is not a real person, but is a monster, sci­ fi character, vampire, or some other creature that needs an imaginary sonic life. Foley is an imperative at this point. When Foley takes on this responsibility, the artist needs to thoroughly understand the narrative in total. What happens to this character? Where is the character, and how do the others relate to this character? Nothing about this character is simple. This is a challenge and can be great fun.

Couldn't find predator walking, so here's a dinosaur 

In Predator (1987), the mysterious hunter’s feet had to be performed first in Foley and then married to a heavy impact edited from sound effects. The result was a very heavy sounding footfall with more impact than we can artfully get on the stage, but with a naturalness and litheness that matched the character.

## Creating Reality 

{{% note %}}
On some of the more expensive and epic films, Foley is often relied on to create many of the effects typically layered and edited in. The rea­sons for this practice vary. Sometimes the effects are quite special and specific and relate to a character.

<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/38328191">Explorers - the spider bit</a> from <a href="https://vimeo.com/user9392196">DAVE STONE</a> on <a href="https://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>

{{% note %}}
In Explorers (1985), the spider’s foot­ steps had to be unique. Tim Sadler, the Foley mixer, had been a music engineer and had creative ideas that derived from that past career. John Roesch and Tim came up with a plan to have a very musical sound for the footsteps. David Stone remembers, “it sounded like fiberglass tub­ ing and that John had manipulated it so it gave off different musical sounds. Each footstep had a different pitch.” At first, Stone and supervi­ sor Mark Mangini figured they would marry the Foley with a designed sound effect by Pospisil. But as they recollect now, they think they relied totally on the Foley because it was so inventive.
