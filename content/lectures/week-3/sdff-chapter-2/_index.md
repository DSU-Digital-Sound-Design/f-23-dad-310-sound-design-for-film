# Foley: history of a craft

#### Foley in the US: Jack Foley

![](foleyartistsCincinnati1945.jpg)

{{% note %}}
Jack Foley was a New Yorker of Irish descent, who grew up on Long Island.

...When Universal needed to add sound to Showboat (1929), Jack seized the opportunity to pitch in and help solve the latest problem brought on by this new technology—or opportunity, depending on one’s perspective.

When The Jazz Singer (1927) was released, Warner Brothers recorded small segments of sound for Al Jolson’s improvisational singing performance while leaving the rest of the film as a silent production.

## Sound as Storyteller 

### Once Upon a Time in the West (1968)

* The sound and dialogue have been completely reproduced in postproduction. The edited sound effects and Foley tell the story. By watching the scene, one can discern a great deal about the characters, the introduction of our key antihero protagonist, and the importance of sound to drive the story and evoke emotion. 
* Plot
  * Three men appear at a train station, slowly and with intention, and proceed to wait. They methodically enter the station, walk­ing on a hollow wooden floor, their dustcoats flapping in the wind. The ticket attendant speaks a few words, which are replaced dialogue, and tries to sell them tickets to the train, which one of our characters tosses into the wind. 
  * One of these three men (Jack Elam) has a battle with a fly. He sits calmly in a creaking wooden rocking chair because it is so hot, and he barely moves while he tries to get the fly out of his face. **He finally captures the fly as he smashes his pistol barrel** against the rocking chair where the fly has landed. **The sound of the fly on his face, on the bench, and in the pistol barrel highlight the character’s patience to wait, kill time, and do as little as possible. Another character (Woody Strode) has water dripping on his hat from a leak in the roof.** Each drip is carefully and artfully designed to emphasize the slowness of the action in the scene. He notices the water drips, but rather than rush to stop the dripping or move from his spot, **he slowly takes his hat off and lets the accumulated water run across the brim of his hat and into his mouth because the day is too hot and he needs the moisture.**
  * The third man (Al Mulock) runs his hands slowly through the water trough. **It is clear to us that the men are “bad guys.” We know this from their intimidating actions and their control of a space that does not belong to them.** They are clearly waiting for the arrival of a train. The wind­ mill in the background squeaks awkwardly. It is a sound effect edited in to have an eerie rhythm that does not match the action but is hypnotic. The footsteps are deliberate and heavy. The plank road is creaky and vacant. The scene is heavy with Foley. The sounds tell the story and support the visual compositions and characters. **When the train arrives, the men see bags being taken off the train and travelers disembarking, but whoever they are waiting for does not appear. Finally, after the train begins to roll away, we notice our protagonist (Charles Bronson) because we hear him play­ ing his harmonica.** The three men turn slowly to look at him, and some dialogue ensues. Elam’s character taunts Bronson’s character, “Looks like we’re shy one horse.” Bronson replies after slowly shaking his head, “You brought one [two?] too many.” The guns are shot, bodies fall down, and the story begins. **It is a bold beginning to a film.**
* Leone replaced all of the sound in all of his films. He preferred to affect the sonic style and have an intentionally artificial sense, yet the sound always progresses the action. The Foley and the edited sound effects are essential characters in all of his films, and this unusual open­ ing illustrates his artful technique. According to Italian Foley artist Marco Ciorba, his father Aldo was one of the Foley artists who worked on Leone’s films. The practice on Leone’s films, reportedly, was to allow the Foley artist to visit the set and watch the actors perform to get a bet­ter sense of how they moved and on what surfaces they walked.

## Foley and first person experience 

- ["Hardcore Henry" (2015)](https://tubitv.com/movies/611901?tracking=justwatch-feed)
- ["Enter the Void" (2009)](https://tubitv.com/movies/100000089) 
- "Doom" (2005) - [First Person Shooter Sequence (Full Scene)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmN1Xk1SdwQ)

{{% note %}}
"Hardcore Henry" (2015) - This entire movie is shot from a first-person perspective, making extensive use of Foley sound to create an immersive experience as the audience sees and hears everything from the protagonist's point of view.

"Enter the Void" (2009) - Directed by Gaspar Noé, this film often employs a first-person perspective to convey the experiences of its protagonist, and Foley sound plays a significant role in immersing the audience in the visual and auditory experience.

"Doom" (2005) - Based on the popular video game series, this film incorporates first-person sequences where Foley sound is used to emphasize the character's point of view, particularly during action scenes.

## Foley and inner turmoil

## Foley and suspense 

- [The Thing Dog Transformation Scene | The Thing (1982) ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_C9JbK7slrk)
- [Poltergeist - Haunted Bedroom Scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8J9sU2n5fIc)

{{% note %}}
In John Carpenter’s The Thing (1982), we encounter a dog that has been absorbed by the “creature.” We watch a dog, accompanied by a crewmate, walk cautiously into a caged area with other dogs. The human footsteps are distinct and precise. This “good dog” is apprehensive as he enters the space. His footsteps are clear and prominent. Another dog, already in the room, begins to growl and threaten, his body writhing and transforming. We hear the “gush, gunk, and gore” that have nowadays become predictable. Accompanying the gore are cicada sounds that are edited effects. The good dog tries to free himself by chewing his way through the metal mesh enclosure, which is a Foley effect. The result is a carefully orchestrated series of sound effects and Foley that together form an auditory “skin crawling” so necessary to the story.

In Poltergeist (1982), we watch as many toys in a child’s bedroom fly through the air and slam into a closet. The music score is loud and obtrusive, so the prop sounds for the toys are equally loud and over­ played. At the end of the scene, the characters handle a simple clown doll as they search for their daughter, who has disappeared. As the action dies down and the worst of the noise and turmoil is over, the irony of the clown being a loved and harmless toy is illustrated by the childlike and
playful jingle added to his hat. The Foley performed for the scene adds to the chaos, then calm, of the psychic phenomenon. Underplayed and realistic Foley would have fallen short of the required task.

## Practical Foley design

- Categories of Foley
  - moves or cloth
  - footsteps
  - specifics, spots, or props

{{% note %}}
Foley is recorded in layers in a Digital Audio Workstation, such as Reaper. This old technique is still used today because digital replacement systems can't match the realism a human performance grants.

One quality of the most experienced Foley artists is to be discriminating about what should be heard and what should be ignored. They learn to help focus the scene with the Foley, not clutter it. The ability to discern what is necessary and what is not becomes even more crucial as the technology allows more choices in shorter time spans.

## Moves

- Cloth track - movement sound of clothing

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-SUcALp4avE" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

This helps bring the image to life, build a sense of intimacy with characters and smooth over joins in the dialogue edit.

The audience should not notice these tracks, however if removed the audience would notice a loss of realism.

Lots of editing is necessary to create moves that are well synced. Any stray sounds where there is no-screen movement must be removed, otherwise the illusion of the foley attaching to the image may be broken.

Moves are often the first pass of a Foley artist doing all of one character through a whole movie so no prop changes are needed.

cotton and denim tend to work well, whereas synthetic fibres can sound a bit thin, or have a scratchy quality, peppered with little click-like sounds.

## Steps

Steps then further define a character. A person's shoes say a lot about their personality. Also, how the person walks can tell you their mood and inner feeling.

Wearing shoes carefully selected for their sound, artists employ a heel-toe technique that creates two distinct sounds for each step, often with an added slide or shuffle as a character comes to a stop.

Importantly, artists must wear very soft clothes, usually cotton, to minimize unwanted noise as they perform.

Any actor interaction that falls outside moves or steps is filed under the category of specifics, or spots.
