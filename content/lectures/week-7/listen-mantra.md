# Editing Mantra L-I-S-T-E-N Step-by-Step Guide

**1. Listen Critically**

Play the audio file and listen to it carefully. Does it sound good? Are there any noticeable problems, such as clicks, pops, or errors? If it doesn't sound good, just delete it. If it does and there are errors, you'll fix them in the next step. 

**2. Identify Clicks, Pops, and Errors**

If you hear any clicks, pops, or errors, use your audio editing software to identify and remove them. You can do this by looking for the offending waveforms and deleting them, or by using a noise reduction tool.

**3. Signal Process (EQ and Compression)**

Use equalization (EQ) and compression to improve the sound of the audio file. EQ can be used to balance the frequencies and remove any unwanted noise. Compression can be used to reduce the dynamic range of the file and make it sound more consistent.

**4. Trim/Crop the File**

Trim or crop the audio file to remove any unwanted silence at the beginning or end. You can also use this step to cut out any sections of the file that you don't need.

**5. Examine Fade-Ins/Fade-Outs at the Zero Line**

If you're using fades, make sure that they start and end at the zero line. This will help to avoid any clicks or pops when the file is played.

**6. Normalize/Name File**

Normalize details to -.5dB. This will ensure that all of your audio files are at a consistent level. You donâ€™t need to normalize ambiences or sound beds; peak points anywhere from -18dB to -6dB are acceptable for these types of sounds. Finally, name the file descriptively and embed it with metadata using expressive keywords.
