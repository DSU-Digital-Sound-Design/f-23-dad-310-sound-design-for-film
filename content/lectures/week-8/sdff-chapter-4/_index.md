# Mood

## Emotion, Tone, and Working with Music

{{% note %}}
Sound design co-creates the mood of a film with the music and visuals

## {{%/ note %}}

## Layers of mood

- Character
  - voice or foley
- Soundscapes or ambience
  - Diegetic - sound of the world of the film
  - Non-diegetic - sound outside the world of the film

{{% note %}}
Non-digetic - These elements have no material cause; instead, they live in the minds of characters, or within layers that can be heard only by the audience. This might be an impact when a title appears, a sound in the protagonist’s imagination, or a ghostly noise to indicate an eerie presence in the room.

## Terminal Sud

[Tubi](https://tubitv.com/movies/606673?tracking=justwatch-feed) - 14:11 - 15:30

{{% note %}}
Relationships in time work to modulate the mood. Context determines how we feel about a certain sound.

Heard in a clearly negative context, as in _Terminal Sud_’s death threat scene, the water striking the window takes on a more menacing quality, growing heavy as the mood darkens.

Terminal Sud summary: In a country headed for civil war, a doctor goes all out to heal and serve all, until he is kidnapped to care for a rebel leader and becomes a target.

## Sound and script

### Two Days, One Night

- [Tubi](https://tubitv.com/movies/684124/two-days-one-night?start=true)
  - Power tools - 20:17 - 24:40
  - Birds in a park - 42:50 - 44:40

Where the script references a sound.

In Two Days, One Night, protagonist Sandra must try to save her job by asking her colleagues to give up their bonuses. As she makes her first house call, we hear an aggressive screeching sound during her approach, which grows louder as she draws near. It reaches an almost unbearable level as she walks into her colleague’s garden, where the source is revealed to be his cutting of tiles with a power tool. The sound of his work elegantly reflects the extreme conflict Sandra feels, as she faces her fear of asking him for a considerable favour.

In a later scene, this tension is conveyed through counterpoint, as Sandra describes her jealous feelings for the birds in a park, whose melodies express a freedom that is in sharp contrast to her own situation.

<!-- ## Tonal Shifts

### Sorry to Bother You

- [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/title/80240589)

{{% note %}}
Emotional changes in films often evolve slowly, but at times a sudden change of approach is used. This is known as a tonal shift.

## Dramatic Irony and Suspense

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rW23RsUTb2Y" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

{{% note %}}
Counterpoint and deliberate anticlimax are both forms of irony, working contrary to what is expected. A different mode is found in dramatic irony, where the audience is allowed to know more than the characters about what is unfolding. This creates a particular form of tension, as the onlooker waits on tenterhooks for the penny to drop in the mind of the character. Non-diegetic sounds play a particularly important role here. For example, the iconic score of Jaws warns the audience of the hidden antagonist’s approach, whilst those within the film remain oblivious.

## The Man Who Knew Too Much

- [Plex](https://watch.plex.tv/movie/the-man-who-knew-too-much-1934) - 54:00 - 58:55

{{% note %}}
This suspension of information, creating excitement or anxiety, is a key element of mood. Alfred Hitchcock often allowed his characters to know more than us, an aspect of his reputation as the master of suspense. He used sound to create this effect during the concert hall finale of The Man Who Knew Too Much, in which the orchestra drowns out the lead characters’ on-screen plotting. Our innate curiosity to know what is happening brings a sense of urgency, propelling the scene forward. Likewise, if a character becomes aware of something off screen, the director might choose to delay, or withhold the revelation of the source, to keep an audience guessing.

## Working With Music

{{% note %}}
Alongside sound design, music is a key maker of mood, often able to express itself more freely when it comes to the image. On smaller productions, a single person may be responsible for both areas, but **usually musical selections and creations are handled by a separate department**. Within this team, a composer writes new pieces, known as music cues, whilst a music supervisor deals with commercial tracks. A music editor works to fit both to the pic

## Pre-existing tracks

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l4q6XiQthfk" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

{{% note %}}
For scenes in which characters need to respond to music directly, as in the sing-alongs of American Honey, the music may be played back during the shoot. If the director is keen to use the on-set recordings, it may be a good idea to capture the scene as a one-shot or with multiple cameras, to avoid the potential minefield of continuity issues. More often, pre-existing tracks are added during the early stages of post, allowing editors to work their cuts accordingly. Choices made after the shoot are subject to change during post, as each track’s usage must be approved, with record labels providing a master licence to the specific recording, and songwriters agreeing to a publishing licence.

## Worldizing

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/z2OoxzYqgNY" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

{{% note %}}
Once the music selections have been made, the clean recordings can be placed within their scenes by applying reverb and EQ, simulating the acoustics of a diegetic space. This is a convenient and effective option, although more interesting results may be achieved using a process called worldizing, pioneered by Walter Murch on American Graffiti. For this technique, the music is played over a speaker into a physical space and the results are recorded; it is similar to using an echo chamber in a studio. This is usually done with a mono speaker and a stereo microphone, experimenting with placement to achieve the desired result. Different set-ups can be captured to give a variety of options, and the effect can later be softened by mixing some of the clean signal back in. In order to emulate a sound-colouring device – a phone, television or car radio, for example – we can use a similar real-world machine for the playback.

## Diegetic Switching

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9_8nY_LQL3w" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

{{% note %}}
It is a device beloved of many directors, where source music transitions into score, or vice versa, in a wink to the audience that acknowledges the artifice of cinema. This can either be done by cutting or crossfading between clean and worldized recordings or by employing different versions of the music itself. During Spock’s funeral in Star Trek II, we hear Scottie playing Amazing Grace on his bagpipes. As the coffin shoots out of the USS Enterprise, an orchestra picks up the melody. Rather than assuming that there is a spacecraft just out of frame that contains an entire symphonic ensemble, the audience readily accepts the melody’s ascent through the layers of cinematic reality.

## Acousmatic Sound

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/718O6L2fWqY" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

{{% note %}}
Moving into the non-diegetic sphere, alongside narration and score there is acousmatic sound. These are effects that have no apparent source within the scene. Genres that deal in supernatural forces, or the workings of the mind, may use this kind of element to communicate unseen events, or create ambiguous moods. The rumble also falls under this heading – not being tied to the image, the sounds instead determine their own shape, in response to the narrative beats of a scene. The overlaid sounds of classic cartoons use a similar device, although in this case it is played for laughs – the tick tock of the character’s thoughts, the ‘ting’ of the lightbulb moment, the tweeting birds that appear after a bump on the head.

In the non-diegetic space, the boundary between sound design and music can become particularly blurred. This creates a potentially delicate political situation with the composer, but it also provides fertile ground for magical transformations.** One such case is Stalker’s first foray into ‘The Zone’, a mysterious realm in which conventional logic breaks down. Here the sound of a railroad cart becomes increasingly melodic in feel, transporting the audience into dream- like territory.**
