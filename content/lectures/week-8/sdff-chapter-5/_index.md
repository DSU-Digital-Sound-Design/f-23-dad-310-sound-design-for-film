## Sound Worlds And Metaphors

{{% note %}}
We'll now go deeper into what sounds mean, how they can either deliver information directly or indirectly. Sound can refer directly, or metaphorically using one thing to refer to another.

But why use metaphor at all?

> A film only exists when it’s reflected in someone’s heart. That’s why I often sit in a cinema and watch some mindless thing on the screen and see people stare at it just as mindlessly, and I realize: this film does not even exist. It provokes no repercussions, no encounters.

> It’s a waste, not only of time. But if a film leaves the space for the spectator to dream himself or herself into it, to read ‘between the lines,’ to fill it with his or her own experiences and thereby make it come to life, then and only then it exists.

You raise an insightful perspective on the nature of cinema. Some key points I gathered:

- Films are interactive experiences between the audiovisual material and the audience. Movies are not static objects, but come alive when viewed. 
- Overly simplistic, spoon-fed narratives tend to bore audiences. Viewers want to be challenged and intellectually engaged.
- Ambiguity and openness to interpretation make a film richer. By allowing space for the audience's imagination, a movie's meaning can expand in multiple directions. 
- The audience is an active participant in constructing the film's significance. Meaning is not inherent in the images/sounds alone, but arises through the interaction between the material and the viewer.

Ultimately, you argue that cinema is a collaborative endeavor between the filmmaker's craft and the audience's imagination. The filmmaker sets the stage, but the audience brings it to life by actively engaging with the meanings, symbols and ambiguities woven into the film. It's a compelling perspective on the nature of the cinematic experience. Let me know if I've accurately summarized your key points! I'm happy to discuss this idea further.

- Their films like Eraserhead and The Elephant Man contain a high degree of ambiguity, leaving much open to interpretation. 
- Repeating industrial images/sounds form symbolic threads, often interpreted as representing dreams and the unconscious mind.
- The machine noises can be heard as metaphors for brain mechanics, with pitch manipulation giving a surreal, otherworldly feel. 
- This transports viewers to places defying straightforward meaning. 
- Cinematic symbols are used to explore mysterious territories where truth cannot be expressed literally.

In short, Lynch/Splet use metaphorical sounds and images as ambiguous, open-ended symbols to suggest the unconscious and evoke a dreamlike atmosphere of multiple meanings. Their films explore the limits of literal meaning through cinematic metaphor.

## Lynch - Blue Velvet

- Diegetic sounds are amplified and highlighted, yet often signify nothing. Dialogue is muted, creating "sonic discomfort". In Blue Velvet, mundane acts like lighting cigarettes are amplified to uncomfortable volumes.
  - Here we hear the sprinkler very loud

Musical texture use as sound effects to create a brooding but ambiguous tone. 

- Sound designer Mark Mangini created many iconic sound effects, like the "spinner" hovercrafts using manipulated bullroarers and subwoofer vibrations.
- His approach involved using sonic metaphors that matched the visuals, like spinning sounds for the spinners. 
- Director Denis Villeneuve had sound inform the edit from the start, allowing it to shape the final picture. 
- Instead of a music-driven score, they used "musical sound effects" to set mood and atmosphere.
- Editor Joe Walker describes their minimalist approach to music, relying more on sound design. 
- The sound team experimented to build complex futuristic audio landscapes.
- Mangini and re-recording mixer Ron Bartlett share insights into the creative sound process.
- The video emphasizes the vital role of sound design in sci-fi and the need to take risks and constantly educate yourself.
- Overall, it provides an inside look at how the team designed the dystopian sonic world of Blade Runner 2049.

## Twin Peaks

- Extra-diegetic music by Angelo Badalamenti evokes nostalgia yet unease. In Twin Peaks, Badalamenti's synthesizer chords float ambiguously as extra-diegetic or "in the air" diegetic sounds. Musical cues undermine traditional rules of film scoring.

## Sound Worlds - Parasite

- [Hulu](https://www.hulu.com/watch/2fd691a0-f66b-467f-8635-00d7f151f3d4)
  - poor families home - start - 6:00
  - Rich people's home - 12:36 - onwards

{{% note %}}
Here's a summary of the key points about the use of sound design in Parasite to contrast the rich and poor families:

- Sound designer Ralph Tae-Young Choi developed distinct sound aesthetics for the two families' spaces.
- The poor family's home is subjected to aggressive outside noises - dogs, cars, neighbors. This represents their lack of barriers from the external world. 
- In the wealthy home, only gentle natural sounds like birdsong enter. Lavish reverb gives interior sounds a sense of openness and scale.
- Doors and gates were emphasized in the sound design. Their sounds represent the division between haves and have-nots. 
- Overall, the contrasting use of invasive versus expansive, harsh versus gentle sounds helps establish the differences between the families' living conditions, resources, and insulation from the outside world.
- The sound design provides auditory metaphors for inequality and the boundaries between rich and poor.

- Sound worlds can be
  - the domain of a **character, group, time or place** (wealthy elite, future, hell);
  - a **story theme** (social structure, technology, religion);
  - a side of a **narrative conflict** (rich vs poor, reality vs fantasy, life
    vs death).
- Created with aesthetic qualities of sound
  - pitch (low, high), rhythm (regular, irregular), timbre (bassy, bright), style (realist, hyperrealist, surrealist).

The previous example created a **sound world**. 

The concept of a "sound world" in film sound design refers to creating distinct auditory environments and aesthetics to represent different aspects of the story, characters, settings, themes, etc. Some key points:

- A sound world is a collection of signature sounds and auditory elements that immerse the audience in a specific mood, time period, location, or perspective.
- Sound worlds establish a sense of place, time, culture, or viewpoint through intentional choices in sound palette and design.
- They allow sound designers to stylize and shape the audience's emotional experience through audio, complementing the visuals.
- Effective sound worlds have cohesive internal logic and consistency even as they contrast with other worlds in the film.
- For example, a sci-fi film may have one sound world for the pristine spaceship interior and another grittier, industrial world for the city slums. 
- Or, a historical drama could differentiate between the elegant sound world of the aristocracy and the lively, chaotic world of the streets.
- Sound worlds help tell the story, communicate characters' inner states, and allow the audience to inhabit the fictional reality more fully through immersive audio.

## Sound World Interaction - Force Majeure

Here is a bullet point summary of the key points:

- Sound worlds in a story must provide tension but ultimately be reconcilable. They can't be too similar or too
- Parasite fuses its contrasting social worlds within the same space, providing an inventive resolution.
- Force Majeure uses contrasting sounds of the resort interior (soft, predictable) and exterior storms (bassy, angular) to depict conflicting worlds. 
- A striking intercutting scene has the family innocently brushing teeth, interspersed with shots of an explosive snowstorm. 
- This audible contrast builds dramatic irony and a sense of two worlds about to collide that only the audience understands.
- Overall, the film uses contrasting sound worlds to reveal the brittle foundations beneath the family's facade of perfection.
- The aesthetic collisions create tension and lead to pivotal revelations.
