{{% note %}}
What happens when a sound wave travels and hits a surface?

#### Echo
- Echo is the phenomenon of hearing a repeated sound after it bounces off a distant surface like a mountain or building.
- The term originates from the Greek myth of Echo and Narcissus, where Echo is cursed to only repeat the last words spoken to her. 
- The effect is essentially a reflection of sound back to the listener.

#### Reverberation (Reverb)
- Reverberation is an extension of the echo effect where multiple echoes bounce between surfaces, creating a decaying tail of sound.
- The length and intensity of the reverb are influenced by the distance between the surfaces and their reflectivity.
- While commonly associated with interior spaces, reverb also occurs in natural environments like forests and urban areas like streets.

#### Resonance
- Resonance occurs when specific frequencies build up due to reflections, a concept known as wave interference.
- Most noticeable in regularly shaped rooms, resonance enhances certain pitches, making them more pronounced.
- It can be both beneficial (e.g., singing in the shower) and problematic (e.g., certain syllables jumping out in interior dialogue recordings).

#### Evocative Use of Sound Effects
- These sound effects can be used not just for realism but also for evoking emotions and creating atmosphere.
- Walter Murch, a renowned sound designer, emphasizes the emotional impact of space around a sound, suggesting that the space itself can be as important as the sound occurring within it.

#### Setting and Character Placement
- The scene takes place in a large hall within a palatial home.
- The protagonist and his wife start the conversation standing in opposite corners of the room.

#### Use of Reverberation
- The characters' voices reverberate significantly when speaking from opposite ends, emphasizing the large space.
- The reverberation effect continues even when the characters stand next to each other.

#### Emotional and Relational Impact
- The continued reverberation when the characters are close to each other serves to underline the emotional and relational distance between them.
- Sound is used as a tool to communicate more than just the physical space; it also signifies the characters' emotional state and relationship dynamics.

In this scene from Citizen Kane, the deliberate use of reverberation in sound design not only depicts the large hall but also amplifies the emotional distance between the characters, serving as a metaphor for their relationship.

#### Concept and Initial Setup
- The sound piece involves reading a few sentences into a microphone that's connected to a recorder.
- The initial recording captures the artist's spoken words in a specific room.

#### Worldizing and Re-Recording Process
- The recording is played back into the room and re-recorded, a technique known as "worldizing."
- This process is repeated multiple times, each time absorbing more of the room's acoustic properties.

#### Acoustic Transformation
- As the re-recording cycle continues, the initially intelligible words evolve into a blend of reverb and resonance.
- The final output is an acoustic "fingerprint" of the room, characterized by a "droning mush" of sound elements.

#### Interpretation and Impact
- The piece illustrates how sound can be shaped and modified by the acoustic properties of a given space.
- It turns the room itself into an active participant in the creation of the sound, emphasizing the room's unique acoustic identity.

Alvin Lucier's "I Am Sitting In A Room" leverages the concept of worldizing to explore and document the unique acoustic characteristics of a room. By repeatedly playing back and re-recording the initial spoken words, the piece transforms the language into an abstract representation of the room's acoustic properties, making the space an integral part of the auditory experience.

- Key Sound Wave Properties
    - Amplitude: Relates to loudness
    - Pitch: Relates to frequency
    - Length: Relates to duration
- Sound Editing Challenges
    - Quiet sounds can get lost under loud ones.
    - Similar pitches can clash, creating dissonance.
    - Need for a balanced mix of momentary and continuous sounds.

### Relationship to Acoustic Effects in Sound Design

#### Foundation in Physics
- Sound behaves as a wave, and this behavior dictates the specific ways acoustic effects like echo, reverberation, and resonance occur.
- While deep knowledge of physics isn't required for sound design, a basic understanding can be beneficial.

#### Sound Wave Properties
- Sound waves have different properties such as amplitude, pitch, and length, which can be visualized using the analogy of water ripples.
  - Amplitude correlates to loudness (height of the water ripples).
  - Pitch correlates to frequency (spacing of the ripples).
  - Length correlates to duration (time taken for water to return to stillness).

#### Practical Considerations in Sound Editing
- Sound editors need to manage these properties to construct effective soundscapes.
  - Quiet sounds can be overwhelmed by loud ones.
  - Similar pitches can clash and create dissonance.
  - A balanced mix often involves a combination of momentary and continuous sounds.

#### Link to Previous Discussions
- Understanding sound as a wave helps to explain why reverberation, resonance, and even worldizing work the way they do.
- The 'fingerprint' of a room's acoustics in Alvin Lucier's piece, or the emotional distance conveyed through reverberation in Citizen Kane, can be better grasped when one understands the basic wave properties of sound.

In summary, the physics of sound as a wave form the foundation for various acoustic effects utilized in sound design. Understanding these principles allows for more nuanced and effective usage of sound to convey different layers of meaning, emotion, or context in a creative work.

### Summary: Understanding the Frequency Spectrum in Sound Design

#### Human Hearing Range
- Lower limit: 20Hz, related to the rate of air molecules moving back and forth.
- Upper limit: 20kHz, decreases with age.

#### Auditory Perception in Animals
- Dogs can hear up to 45kHz.
- Cats can hear up to 79kHz.

#### Sounds Outside Human Perception
- Some sounds, like those from geological events or subwoofers, can fall below 20Hz.
- These low-frequency sounds can be felt but not heard.

#### Analyzing Sound Frequencies
- Like light, sounds can be analyzed in terms of their component frequencies.

#### Spectral Masking
- When sounds in similar frequency ranges overlap, they can obscure each other.
- This phenomenon is especially problematic at lower frequencies.

#### Practical Applications in Mixing
- Re-recording mixers aim to avoid clashes in the frequency spectrum.
- Masking can be leveraged to cover up unwanted noise by adding atmos or music with similar frequencies.

Understanding the frequency spectrum is crucial in sound design, particularly when it comes to avoiding clashes between different sound elements. Knowing the range of human hearing, as well as how sounds outside that range can affect perception, offers practical applications for creating a balanced and effective audio environment.

### Summary: Pitch Layering and Shifting in Sound Design

#### Pitch Layering
- Technique of using the same sound at different pitches for a complex result.
- Useful for aesthetic effects, especially in sci-fi genres.

#### Time Offsetting
- Experimentation with time differences between layered sounds.
- Applications include creating endless explosions or suggesting movement.

#### Relationship with Music
- Pitch shifting can align or disalign sounds with the underlying score.
- Creates interesting tonal relationships or dissonance.

#### Natural vs. Time-Corrected Pitch Shifting
- Natural shifting alters pitch and speed equally, mimicking slowing down a tape.
- Time-corrected shifting maintains timing but may introduce synthetic artifacts.

By understanding and applying pitch layering and shifting, sound designers can create complex and nuanced audio landscapes. This technique is particularly valuable in genres like sci-fi and for establishing tonal relationships with musical scores. The choice between natural and time-corrected pitch shifting can also have a significant impact on the final audio output.
