# Assignment 2: Studio Foley Recording

Download the video [here](../HardSurface_robot_animation-346689615.mp4)

Working with your team of three (or two) from Assignment 1, you will use Reaper (or another DAW) to record and layer Foley sound effects for the animation.

What sound sources do you use this time around? Think about the strengths and weaknesses of your previous Foley work. You will have complete control over how these sounds are recorded, making it easier to work with objects that are very quiet or too temperamental for a live performance. In addition, working with your group of three, you can build up many layers of sound and adjust the levels so that every element is balanced to match the on-screen animation.

As before, you may organize your recording and sounds however you see fit. It is still helpful to think of the robot as feet & legs, torso & head, arms & fingers. However, you can record each body part separately, so there are many ways to put your final Foley design together: just the feet, the eyes, the fingers, etc. Discuss with your group and choose the best approach for your available time and props.

Remember that animation means "bring to life." Reflect on the sounds that will lead your audience to believe this robot moves and dances autonomously. Groups should pay close attention to the synchronization and final balance of all sounds in their work.

Project requirements\:

- The animation is 10 seconds long; all objects and events that make a sound must be represented somehow.
- Evaluations will be based on the efforts of your entire group. This includes the sound quality of your recordings, synchronization, and overall mix/balance of the final Foley design.
- Your group should zip \(compress as a zip archive\) your **entire** DAW session \(including all audio and video files\) and post to D2l on or before the assignment due date.
