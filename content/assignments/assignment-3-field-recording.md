# Assignment 3: Zoom (Field) SFX Recording

Using the Zoom H4n recorder, make the following 5 recordings:

## Ambience Beds

Use the **onboard X/Y microphone** on the Zoom H4n 

1.  Record 2-3 minutes of ambience in a LARGE environment like a gymnasium, parking garage, or stadium.
2.  Record 2-3 minutes of ambience in a SMALL environment like a closet, bathroom, or office.  

Capture consistent background sound in each environment. There may be intermittent disturbances, but those can be edited out later.

## Ambience Details 

Use the **Rode NTG5** external microphone plugged into the Zoom H4n

3. Record 1-2 minutes of a LARGE object, device or event like a truck, industrial machine, or crowd. Evoke as much focused sound as possible.
4. Record 1-2 minutes of a MEDIUM object or device like a door, fan, or keyboard. 
5. Record 1-2 minutes of a SMALL object or device like keys, pens, or footsteps.

For each object/device, vary the sound by:
- Duration: Make short and long takes.
- Frequency: Vary timing between events. 
- Impact: Vary force and intensity.
- Perspective: Move the microphone for different perspectives.
- Speed: Make takes at different speeds/intensities. 

## Set Proper Levels 

- Quieter environments: between -50 dB and -20 dB
- Louder environments: between -6 and dB -3 dB

## Recording Format 

- Record at 96kHz/24bit for the best quality. See [this page](https://www.zoom.co.jp/sites/default/files/products/downloads/pdfs/E_H4n_Pro.pdf#page=47) for instructions on changing the format. 
## Slate Recordings

Before each take, slate the recording by stating:
- Name of object, location or event
- Specific details 
- Activity being performed

Example slates:
- "Door knock, hollow wood door using open palm."
- "Forest ambience, with stream nearby." 
- "Typing on mechanical keyboard, individual key presses."

## Deliverables

Create a Reaper project with 5 tracks per recording to prepare for editing in the next assignment.
