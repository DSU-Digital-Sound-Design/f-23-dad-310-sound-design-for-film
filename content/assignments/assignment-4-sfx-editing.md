# Assignment 4: SFX Editing
### Part 1 - Editing

**1. Collect Your Recordings**: 

Make sure you have the five recordings from Assignment 3 ready. These include recordings of LARGE and SMALL environments, as well as LARGE, MEDIUM, and SMALL object/device/event sounds.

**2. Edit Large and Small Environments**:
   - Start with the LARGE environment recording.
   - Listen to the recording and identify any unwanted or unintended sounds.
   - Use editing tools (e.g., cut, fade, silence) to remove these unwanted portions.
   - Ensure that the final edited version is exactly 1 minute long.

**3. Repeat for Small Environment**:
   - Follow the same steps as above for the SMALL environment recording.
   - Edit out unwanted sounds and ensure the edited version is 1 minute long.

**4. Create Variations for Object/Device/Event Sounds**:
   - Now, move on to the LARGE object/device/event recording.
   - Edit five variations of each large, medium, and small object/device/event giving you 15 short sound effects. 

**5. Total Count**: After completing Part 1, you should have 17 edited sound files. Two for environments and five variations for each type of object/device/event sound.

### Part 2 - Processing

1. **Processing for Environments**:
   - For the LARGE and SMALL environments:
     - If necessary, normalize each recording within the range of -16 to -12 dB.
     - Apply equalization to make them sound natural and realistic.

2. **Processing for Object/Device/Event Sounds**:
   - For the LARGE, MEDIUM, and SMALL object/device/event sounds:
     - Normalize each recording to -0.5 dB.
     - Apply equalization and light compression if necessary. 

3. **Bouncing**:
   - Bounce WAVs of all five variations of each sound (two stereo environments and three mono object/device/event sounds).

4. **Submission**:
   - Submit the Reaper project and each rendered ambience/sound effect.
