For this assignment, **you will work in a team of three (or two)** to replace the sounds of this animation with Foley. 

What sound sources do you use? Think about the materials the robot consists of. Consider the surface it stands on and the room it is in. Imagine the mechanisms within the metal that form its "skin." Considering these will help you find the proper objects for your Foley design.  

You may organize your work in any way you see fit. If each group member is responsible for the sounds of the various robot parts, you should be able to cover the entire character sonically. _Animation_ means "bring to life." Reflect on the kinds of sounds that will further convey an impression of "life" and work these into your Foley design. 
 
Project requirements:  
-	The animation is 10 seconds long; create a Foley effect for all animation events that make sound.  
-	All sound-making objects are fair game for this assignment.  
-	Evaluations will be based on the performance and sound quality of the entire group. Work together, and everyone will benefit!
