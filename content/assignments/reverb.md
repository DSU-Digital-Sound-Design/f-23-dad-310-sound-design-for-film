title: "Reverb/echo"
---

We'll do a short assignment where we use different plugins in Reaper to put a sound in different places.

For this assignment we'll use the following plugins: ReaDelay, ReaVerbate, and ReaVerb.

You will be adding onto your sound effects assignment. You will **create four sends for four different types of acoustic spaces** for sound effects. Name each one, ex. "large space", "small bathroom", etc.

A delay with a medium length delay time can create the impression of a large space because there will be audible echos. This is the same effect as when you're outside and you hear sound bouncing off of a building.

The ReaVerbate plugin is a digital reverb plugin where the space is synthesized. The main controls are the room size, dampening and initial delay.

The ReaVerb plugin is an impulse response reverb plugin. This allows you to add the sound of real spaces to your audio. This is a very useful sound design plugin.

To get free impulse responses go to [OpenAir](https://www.openair.hosted.york.ac.uk/).

> Attention!! Make sure to include your impulse response file with your project. You have to do this manually. Just drag and drop it into the folder where your other sound files are.

Submit your project file to D2L by next Tuesday October 31st.
